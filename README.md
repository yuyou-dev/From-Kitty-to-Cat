# From Kitty to Cat

## 1. Introduction:
"From Kitty to Cat" is an H5 game based on physics engine(Matter.js), which we call FKC for short. To facilitate other developers potential extension, we open-source the basic modules of this game in this project. Besides, teaching videos and related demos are also available in it.
  

## Remarks:
I also made a series of courses called “The Innovative Programming”. In this course, I will show you the magic when programs are combined with interesting background in the creativity industry. The content of this course includes AI programms, games, dynamic visual effect and so on.
